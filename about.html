        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            The genesis of my journey into coding stemmed from a longstanding aspiration to develop a Discord bot. Initially, I explored alternatives to coding, opting for applications to streamline the process. This pursuit began in 2019, utilizing my iPhone SE for experimentation. However, it wasn't until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with prolonged school closures, that I found myself with ample time to delve into coding. My foray into this realm commenced with Zepp, known then as Roumy, which can still be found on top.gg due to an unfortunate loss of access to my Discord account necessitating a name change. Initially, I commenced with modest Python scripts, often relying on solutions from platforms like Stack Overflow. Over time, I transitioned to crafting my own commands and ultimately shifted my focus to JavaScript, a decision I now wholeheartedly appreciate. Embracing JavaScript not only facilitated the evolution of my Discord bot but also empowered me to venture into web development, culminating in the creation of this very website. From humble beginnings on my mobile device to now flourishing on my laptop, the journey from Python to JavaScript has proven immensely rewarding and transformative. If you find yourself at a crossroads contemplating a transition from Python to JavaScript, I wholeheartedly endorse it, as it has enriched my coding experience immeasurably.
